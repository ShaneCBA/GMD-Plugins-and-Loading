Thanks for downloading Serene Loading Screen! This file explains how to set up your server and loading screen.
[Created By: http://steamcommunity.com/id/shane_is_tired]

Getting Started:
	Place the "Serene Loading Screen" folder into you web server. Then set up your server.cfg to match the directory of the loading screen. Better explanation is here : https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Loading_URL
	You MUST have '?steamid=%s' in your sv_loadingurl or this will not work
Setting Up:
	Once you hosting done, you need to edit a file called "login.php". It it you will see:
  //PASSWORD AND USERNAME. DO NOT SHARE
    $USERNAME = "<username here>";
    $PASSWORD = "<password here>";
  //-----------------------------------//
	!!!DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING BUT THESE TWO LINES!!!
	Replace <username here> and <password here> with your specific password and username. Make sure not to share with anyone else. If you do, they can access you settings.
	
	Once you set the username and password, go to the directory of the loading screen, and go to login.php . Then use the username and password from earlier to login. You will be redirected to settings.php. You will have to re-login once every 24 hours for security reasons.
Settings Page:
	The settings are pretty simple:
	Server Box & Rules Box:
		Title Font         : Font size of the title of specific box
		Table Font         : Font size of the content of specific box
		Disabled           : Disables specific box
	Player Info:

	Theme:
		Progress Bar Color : Change the color of the progress bar
		Primary Color      : Basically, the color of the titles and avatar
		Background Folder  : Folder of the background to cycle through. Use ./Backgrounds instead of hostname.com/dir/Backgrounds for easier setup
		Box Shadow:        : The shadow underneath all the boxes
		Logo Height        : Pretty self explanitory
	Misc.:
		Youtube Music      : Set the youtube music that plays in the background. To enable, tick the checkbox. Youtube music will override all other. To set the music, just open up a song on youtube and copy the url at the top of the screen. No need for embeded nonsense
		Logo Image         : Set the logo of the page to a specific image
Music:
	To play music, either set the Youtube Music in the settings, and tick the checkbox; or drag a .ogg or .mp4 music file into the /Music/ directory.
